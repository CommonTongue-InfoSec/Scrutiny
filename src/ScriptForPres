From the form you completed for us prior to meeting, we did our research to develop a pure risk assessment.  

You gave us quite a lot to work with by providing the penetration test report from the National Guard.

What we put togther is kind of a survey of some key issues we were able to research and contribute advice for.

Obviously, we talked about continuing the relationship between Sierra Vista and the school 
and we hope this is a helpful start.

Some key topics we address here are password policy, access to backups and installations, 
DNS configurations and the state of inactive accounts.  

All our reccomendations will be some variety of general policy advice for the issues
and to the extent possible, specific timelines for the actions we discuss.
